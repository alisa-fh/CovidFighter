# Covid Fighter
A 2D tile-based tower defence game for my third year Game Development and Multimedia module.

In order to run the game, open the project in Unity and click **_build game_**, toggling **_maximise on play_** beforehand. Gameplay is straightforward, follow on-screen instructions, and simply use the keypad to click. In order to pause, click the **_escape_** key.

This game was created using Unity and written in C#.

Feel free to download and play with the project.

Alternatively, watch an overview by downloading the trailer [Covid-19 Fighter Video.mp4](<./Covid-19 Fighter Video.mp4>). 
###### (I don't normally speak that rushed... we had a time limit)
