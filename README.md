# Covid Fighter
A 2D tile-based tower defence game for my third year Game Development and Multimedia module.

This game was created using Unity and written in C#.

Feel free to download and play with the project.

Alternatively, watch an overview by downloading the trailer [Covid-19 Fighter Video.mp4](<./Covid-19 Fighter Video.mp4>).
