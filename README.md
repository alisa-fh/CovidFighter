# Covid Fighter
A 2D tile-based tower defence game for my third year Game Development and Multimedia module.

In order to run the game, open the project in Unity and click "build game", toggling "maximise on play" beforehand. Gameplay is straightforward, follow on-screen instructions, and simply use the keypad to click. In order to pause, click the "Escape Key".

This game was created using Unity and written in C#.

Feel free to download and play with the project.

Alternatively, watch an overview by downloading the trailer [Covid-19 Fighter Video.mp4](<./Covid-19 Fighter Video.mp4>).
